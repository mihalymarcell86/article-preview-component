## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass, CSS animation
- Vanilla JS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I practiced animating with this project.
I learned about the `animation-fill-mode` property, which allows the animation to apply styles to the target element before or after execution. It is easy to trip up on it as well: if one wants to change that given property, one has to remove the animation first, otherwise it "keeps hold" of it.

### Useful resources

- [cubic-bezier](https://cubic-bezier.com/) - Very straight forward visual UI for comparing cubic-bezier curves.
